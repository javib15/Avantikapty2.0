								<li>For cash payments, you will be asked to pay the difference of the balance if the new food has a greater value than the food received in error.
									In the same way, you will receive the difference of the balance back as credit for the new item if less than the food received in error. 
									In some cases, we may offer you a store credit.</li></p> 
							<p>You order will be priority if you come to pick it up. In all cases, please return the food order in the original container(s)* to our host.</p>
							<h4> Order Incomplete*</h4>
								<p>In the rare occasion that you do not receive food that is on your receipt, we will make it up to you. Please call us or your third-party delivery 
									service as soon as you notice that any food items were not received in your order. You may cancel the missed food before we prepare it without any question,
								 	and we will refund the amount to a credit card, or we will refund you, This has to be done on the same business day that the food was ordered & prepared.</p>
								<p><strong>Please note:</strong> we do provide courtesy items such as disposable silverware, chopsticks, etc. when requested for free. If we mistakenly omit a 
									free courtesy item you are welcome to let us know so we may address the issue with our staff, however, we cannot provide discounts, refunds or store credit.</p>

							<h4>Food Dissatisfaction*</h4>
								<p>We cook our food fresh to order with only the finest and freshest ingredients. We take great care and pride in all of the dishes we make. Refunds and/or replacement
									food are available upon request for orders in which the food is wrong, omitted and other similar circumstances.<strong> Refunds are not typically provided for food that a 
									guest simply does not like.</strong></p>
							<H4>Spice Level*</H4>
								<p>We offer a choice of spice levels (Mild, Medium, Hot, and Thai Hot) but spice can be different for everyone. We usually suggest that you are 
									on the side of caution and choose a lower spice level because you can add spice in but can’t take it out! We do not offer discounts or refunds
									 for a preferred different spice level, but please let us know if you’d like us to add a side of ground chili, chili sauce or Sriracha for you. 
									 Please note: for extra a side of ground chili, chili sauce or Sriracha, price starts from $0.50 & up)</p>

								<p>Sorry, we cannot cancel, refund or give store credit if you change your mind or mistakenly order an item after the order is prepared. 
									We cannot provide any refund or store credit for non-food items or beverages.</p>
							<H4>Order Cancelled Delivery Partner</H4>
								<p>It’s possible your delivery partner might cancel the delivery if they’re unable to find or reach you. When they arrive at your delivery address, 
									they’re prompted to contact you so it’s a good idea to keep your phone nearby when you’re expecting the food to arrive. If a delivery partner 
									made a reasonable effort to contact you after arriving at your requested location, you may not be eligible for a refund.</p>
								<p>As a private business, it is the right of the restaurant to deny or refuse service to any customer for any reason. If a customer
									abuse any of the Return & Refund Policy we, unfortunately, will not be able to conduct future business with the customer so that we 
									may continue to provide excellent and quality food and service for you and our other wonderful and frequent patrons.</p>

									sauce, and consistency of some items may vary slightly after being packaged.</p>	
								<p>*If 25% or more of the food has been consumed or removed we cannot issue any discount, refund or store credit. If the food has been discarded,
									repackaged or tampered with then we cannot verify its origin or issue and cannot issue any discount, refund or store credit. Also, we will only
